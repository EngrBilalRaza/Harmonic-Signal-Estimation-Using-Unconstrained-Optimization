# Harmonic-Signal-Estimation-Using-Unconstrained-Optimization
This MATLAB project implements harmonic signal estimation by applying unconstrained optimization techniques to minimize the error between a noisy signal and its estimated components. The script synthesizes a multi-harmonic signal, adds Gaussian noise, and utilizes optimization to accurately reconstruct the original waveform.
